Step 1: Clone the repository to your local system and visualise the current output in the live server.
Step 2 : Take a look at the index.html and CSS structure provided t you.
Step 3 : Navigate to app.js and start referncing the elements from the DOM and complete the functions to achieve desired utput as shown in the image above.
Step 4: Complete the functions and verify against the test cases.


- When you open the index.html file in your browser, you'll see a text box to enter a number, two radio buttons to choose the shape (Circle or Square), and a button to generate the shapes.
- Enter a number in the text box (e.g., 5).
- Select either the "Circle" or "Square" radio button to choose the shape type.
- Click the "Generate Shapes" button.
- The shapes will appear below the button with numbers inside them.
**What happens when you click the button**
- The function reads the number from the input and the selected shape type.
- It then creates that number of shapes (either circles or squares) and adds them to the page with numbers inside them.

The index.html and css files are given to you, the elements from html is also referenced in the app.js file. All that you have to do is complete the button.on click function and make the application functional.


Happy Coding Kalvium ❤️
